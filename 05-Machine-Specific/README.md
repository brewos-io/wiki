## Machine Types

BrewOS supports three main machine architectures:

### Dual Boiler
- Separate brew and steam boilers
- Independent temperature control
- Examples: ECM Synchronika, Profitec Pro 700

### Single Boiler
- One boiler for both brewing and steaming
- Temperature surfing required
- Examples: ECM Barista, Profitec Pro 300

### Heat Exchanger (HX)
- Steam boiler with heat exchanger for brew water
- Simultaneous brew and steam capability
- Examples: ECM Mechanika, Profitec Pro 500

## Configuration

Each machine type requires specific configuration:
- **Machine type selection** - Set during initial setup
- **Temperature setpoints** - Machine-specific defaults
- **Wiring considerations** - May vary by machine
- **Sensor placement** - Machine-specific locations

## Compatibility

See [Compatibility List](Compatibility-List.md) for:
- Validated machines
- Expected compatible machines
- Machine-specific notes
- Wiring compatibility
